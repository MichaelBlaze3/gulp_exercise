# Gulp JS

## How Gulp Works
* Build on __node streams__
* Pipelines / __.pipe()__ operator
* Single purpose pluggins
* File not affected until all pluggins are processed

## Gulp vs Grunt
* Gulp is code over configuration, Grunt is configuration over code.
* Gulp is easier to read than Grunt
* Gulp is based on streams, Grunt is based on files.

## Requirements
* NodeJS

## Installation
Install Gulp globally using npm(Node Package Manager) from NodeJS.
```
    $ npm install -g gulp 
```

also we will need to install gulp locally in our project

```
    $ npm install --save-dev gulp
```
